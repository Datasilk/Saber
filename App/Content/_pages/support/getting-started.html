<p>So you want to create email campaigns within Gmail. That's awesome! Now let's get you started on your journey to engaging with your potential customers!</p>

<div class="scroll-to" id="chrome-extension"></div>
<h2>Get the Chrome Extension</h2>
<p>
    Gmaster is built to load within <b>Gmail</b>, so before you can begin using it, you must first install the Gmaster Chrome extension. In order to install the
    extension, you'll first need to <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">download the Chrome web browser</a> and open this website via Chrome.
</p>

<p>
    After opening Chrome, you can click the button at the top-right corner of this page labeled "<b>Install Chrome Extension</b>". From within the Chrome Web Store,
    you'll be able to install the Gmaster Chrome Extension. Once you're done, come back to this page and follow the next steps.
</p>

<div class="scroll-to" id="sign-in"></div>
<h2>Sign In to Gmail</h2>
<p>
    To sign up for Gmaster or log into your existing Gmaster account, you will be prompted with a Google Sign-In popup window once you go to 
    <a href="https://www.gmail.com" target="_blank">www.gmail.com</a> and log into your <b>Gmail</b> account. Once you sign into your Google account 
    using the account associated with your Gmail inbox, your email address will be automatically registered with Gmaster. Afterwards, you won't be prompted 
    for the Google Sign-In window again unless you log in to Gmail from another PC, or from another Google account in Chrome.
</p>

<div class="scroll-to" id="subscribe"></div>
<h2>Choose a Subscription</h2>
<p>
    Once you've logged into your Gmaster account within Gmail, if you don't already have a subscription plan, you'll automatically be redirected to the
    subscription plan page. From there, you can choose from four plan types;
    <a href="/support/subscriptions#beginner">Beginner</a>, 
	<a href="/support/subscriptions#daily">Daily</a>,
	<a href="/support/subscriptions#pro">Pro</a>, &
	<a href="/support/subscriptions#team">Team</a> plans.
</p>
<p>
    Each plan will have unique benefits based on price, and the <b>Team</b> plan will have all the benefits of the <b>Pro</b> plan, but at a lower
    price per user (minimum 2 users).
</p>

<div class="scroll-to" id="pay"></div>
<h2>Pay with Card or PayPal</h2>
<p>
    After choosing a subscription, you'll be given the choice of paying with either a credit card or with PayPal. Once you decide your payment method, 
    it may take a few moments before your payment is approved, and then all of Gmaster's features will be unlocked within Gmail.
</p>
