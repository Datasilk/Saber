# Saber
A simple, straight-forward CMS.

### Introduction
The above statement is true for the end-user, but for us developers who wish to work on the Saber platform, it will be a difficult journey. Luckily, this project adheres to many standard development practices and design patterns, so it shouldn't be too difficult to navigate and produce new, exciting features.

#### Folder Structure

* **wwwroot**
  * Most of the content that exists in this folder is generated by `gulp` from files that exist within various folders, including *Content*, *CSS*, & *Scripts*. Other files include editor-specific images and fonts. Many folders & files are specifically created by users who work within the Saber Editor GUI, uploading content for their website.
* **Common**
  * Many static classes exist in the common folder and some are shared between *Controllers* & *Services*. These classes contain common functionality that can be used across many parts of the project. Otherwise known as the *Business Logic Layer*.
* **Content**
  * All content related to the custom website will be stored in this folder. 
  * **pages**
    *  all files related to a web page will be stored here (*.html, *.js, *.less, *.json), including language files & page settings files.
  * **partials**
    * All partial HTML files will be stored here and can be accessed via the *file browser* within Saber's Editor GUI. These files can be referenced in page HTML files.
  * **temp**
    * When Saber's web server loads, it checks to see if a *home.html* file exists in the *Content/pages* folder. If not, Saber will proceed to copy all the files from the *temp* folder into various folders throughout the project in order to initialize the default website that comes with the Saber platform.
* **Controllers**
  * Classes that are bound to URLs within the website. 
    * The **Editor** class is responsible for rendering all web pages for the user's website. It is also responsible for rendering the Editor GUI on top of all web pages when the user is logged into their account.
	* The **login** class is only used if no user accounts exist, and is loaded so that the administrator can create their account.
	* The **Logout** class is used to log a user out of their account, which then redirects the user to the login page.
	* The **Upload** class is used to receive raw file data from the user while uploading resources for their website via the Editor GUI.
* **Core**
  * This folder is a git submodule for the *Datasilk Core* MVC framework. All page & web service requests are handled & routed via this framework.
* **CSS**
  * All site-wide CSS & LESS files are stored here, and gulp compiles the LESS and copies them into the *wwwroot/css* folder. 
  * **tapestry**
    * This folder is a git submodule for the CSS UI framework Tapestry, which is used for Saber's Editor GUI.
  * **themes**
    * Tapestry color schemes for Saber's Editor GUI reside in this folder
  * **platform.less**
    * This CSS file is the main style sheet used by Saber's Editor GUI
  * **website.less**
    * This CSS file can be modified via Saber's Editor GUI and is loaded on every page of the user's website.
* **Models**
  * Class files that represent data structures belong in this folder
* **Scripts**
  * All ECMAScript libraries exist in this folder, and `gulp` is responsible for compiling them and copying them into the *wwwroot/js* folder. 
  * **platform**
    * This folder is a git submodule for the *Datasilk Core Js* framework that is used alongside the *Datasilk Core* framework. It contains features such as a modal popup, drag & drop events, svg sprite loader, and a simple scaffolding framework like *Mustache*.
  *  **selector**
     *  This folder is a git submodule for a jQuery replacement developed by Mark Entingh. It is used instead of jQuery because it weighs in under 5kb in size after being minified & gzip compressed.
  * **utility**
    * This folder contains various 3rd-party ECMAScript libraries and can also be viewed within Saber's Editor GUI, thus allowing users to upload their own JS libraries to use within their website.
  * **website.js** 
    * This JavaScript file is loaded on every page within the user's website. It can be edited via the Editor GUI and is compiled by *gulp* and copied to `/wwwroot/js/` when changes are made. 
* **Services**
  * This folder contains all the *Service* classes that are responsible for handling web service API requests.
